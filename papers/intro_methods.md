## Introduction

Religious and moral systems represent one of the most universal features of human societies, yet their evolutionary origins and functional significance remain subjects of considerable debate (Norenzayan, 2013; Boyer, 2001). While traditional approaches have emphasized the spiritual, social, or symbolic functions of religious practices, a growing body of research suggests that many religious prohibitions and cultural taboos may encode practical survival wisdom developed over millennia (Harris, 1985; Simoons, 1994).

The Cultural Survival Framework proposes that religious systems function as sophisticated survival technologies, preserving and transmitting critical knowledge through oral traditions that persist across cultural transitions and environmental challenges. This framework suggests that what we interpret as divine revelation may actually represent the crystallized survival wisdom of our species, encoded in memorable and transmissible forms that ensure compliance through supernatural authority (Henrich, 2015; Boyd & Richerson, 2005).

### Theoretical Background

Cultural evolution theory demonstrates that human behaviors and beliefs undergo selection processes analogous to biological evolution, with beneficial cultural variants becoming more prevalent while harmful variants are eliminated (Mesoudi, 2011; Richerson & Boyd, 2005). Religious practices, as culturally transmitted behaviors with high fidelity and strong social enforcement mechanisms, represent prime candidates for this type of cultural selection (Atran & Henrich, 2010).

Previous research has documented correlations between specific religious practices and survival benefits in limited contexts. Harris (1985) demonstrated that Hindu cow protection optimizes caloric returns in agricultural societies, while Douglas (2002) showed that biblical dietary laws correlate with food safety concerns in ancient Near Eastern environments. However, no systematic cross-cultural analysis has examined whether these correlations represent general patterns or isolated coincidences.

Recent advances in cultural phylogenetics and cross-cultural databases enable more rigorous testing of hypotheses about religious evolution (Gray et al., 2009; Watts et al., 2015). The availability of comprehensive ethnographic data across diverse cultures provides unprecedented opportunities to examine whether religious practices systematically encode survival-relevant knowledge across human societies.

### The Survival Domains Framework

Religious practices potentially address five primary survival domains that represent fundamental challenges for human groups: Food Safety and Nutrition (FSN), Disease Prevention and Health (DPH), Resource Conservation and Management (RCM), Social Cooperation and Stability (SCS), and Environmental Adaptation (EA). Each domain encompasses specific survival challenges that could be addressed through culturally transmitted behavioral rules enforced by religious authority.

Food Safety and Nutrition practices include dietary restrictions, preparation methods, and consumption timing that prevent foodborne illness, nutritional deficiencies, or resource depletion. Disease Prevention and Health practices encompass hygiene protocols, quarantine procedures, and health maintenance behaviors that reduce pathogen transmission and promote physical wellbeing. Resource Conservation and Management practices involve sustainable use of natural resources, tool preservation, and waste reduction strategies. Social Cooperation and Stability practices include conflict resolution mechanisms, resource sharing protocols, and authority structures that maintain group cohesion. Environmental Adaptation practices encompass seasonal timing, migration patterns, and disaster preparedness behaviors that optimize survival in specific ecological contexts.

### Research Questions and Hypotheses

This study addresses three primary research questions: (1) Do religious practices systematically correlate with demonstrable survival benefits across cultures? (2) Do these correlations vary by survival domain and environmental context? (3) Can the strength of evidence for survival benefits predict confidence in the adaptive function of religious practices?

We hypothesized that religious practices would show significant positive correlations with survival benefits, with stronger correlations in practices addressing immediate physical survival needs (food safety, disease prevention) compared to those addressing longer-term social survival needs (cooperation, resource management). We further hypothesized that practices originating in harsh environmental contexts would show stronger survival correlations than those from benign environments.

## Methods

### Database Development

We developed a comprehensive database of religious practices from diverse cultures worldwide using systematic search protocols across ethnographic databases, religious texts, and anthropological literature. Initial candidate practices were identified through searches of the Human Relations Area Files (HRAF), ethnographic atlases, and comparative religion databases using keywords related to prohibitions, taboos, dietary laws, ritual requirements, and moral codes.

Inclusion criteria required that practices: (1) be explicitly connected to religious or moral authority, (2) involve specific behavioral prescriptions or prohibitions, (3) be documented in academic sources with sufficient detail for analysis, and (4) represent stable cultural traditions rather than recent innovations. Practices were excluded if they primarily addressed supernatural concerns without plausible connections to material survival, or if documentation was insufficient to assess potential survival benefits.

### Systematic Coding Framework

Each practice was coded across 29 variables capturing basic descriptive information, survival domain classifications, evidence quality assessments, and source documentation. Key variables included Practice ID, Local Name, English Translation, Culture/Religion, Geographic Region, Climate Zone, Time Period, Population Size, Practice Description, Enforcement Type, Authority Source, Frequency, and Participants.

Survival benefit analysis focused on five primary domains: Food Safety and Nutrition (FSN), Disease Prevention and Health (DPH), Resource Conservation and Management (RCM), Social Cooperation and Stability (SCS), and Environmental Adaptation (EA). Each practice was assigned to one primary domain and could include multiple secondary domains. Survival mechanisms were described in detail, with quantifiable benefits documented when available.

### Evidence Quality Assessment

Evidence for survival benefits was evaluated using a five-level classification system: Level 5 (Definitive) indicating peer-reviewed scientific studies confirming benefits with clear causal mechanisms and no significant contradictory evidence; Level 4 (Strong) indicating well-documented correlations with logical mechanisms and expert consensus; Level 3 (Moderate) indicating clear logical connections with some documentary evidence; Level 2 (Suggestive) indicating plausible connections with limited direct evidence; and Level 1 (Speculative) indicating possible benefits requiring further investigation.

Each practice received a confidence score (4-9 scale) reflecting the overall strength of evidence for adaptive function, considering source quality, logical consistency, quantifiability of benefits, and presence of contradictory evidence. Confidence scores were assigned independently of evidence levels to enable validation of the classification system.

### Geographic and Cultural Controls

To address concerns about cultural diffusion and geographic clustering, we recorded precise geographic coordinates when available and tracked cultural relationships through language families, historical contact patterns, and migration routes. Spatial autocorrelation analysis using Moran's I statistic tested whether similar practices clustered geographically beyond what would be expected from independent cultural evolution.

Cultural independence was assessed through phylogenetic analysis of cultural relationships, examining whether practices showed patterns consistent with vertical inheritance (descent from common ancestral cultures) versus horizontal transmission (spread through cultural contact) versus convergent evolution (independent development of similar solutions).

### Statistical Analysis

Primary analysis examined correlations between evidence levels and confidence scores using Pearson correlation coefficients. Secondary analyses explored relationships between survival domains and evidence quality using ANOVA, geographic patterns using spatial autocorrelation statistics, and environmental factors using regression analysis.

Bootstrap resampling (n=1000) tested the stability of correlation estimates, while sensitivity analysis examined robustness to alternative coding decisions. All analyses were conducted using R statistical software with appropriate packages for spatial analysis (spdep), cultural phylogenetics (ape), and bootstrap procedures (boot).

### Sample Characteristics

The final database included 151 religious practices from 74 distinct cultures across 45 geographic regions, providing global coverage with representation from all inhabited continents and major climate zones. The sample included 21 practices in Food Safety and Nutrition (13.9%), 25 in Disease Prevention and Health (16.6%), 20 in Resource Conservation and Management (13.2%), 63 in Social Cooperation and Stability (41.7%), and 22 in Environmental Adaptation (14.6%).

Evidence levels were distributed as follows: Level 5 (11 practices, 7.3%), Level 4 (46 practices, 30.5%), Level 3 (54 practices, 35.8%), Level 2 (33 practices, 21.9%), and Level 1 (7 practices, 4.6%). Confidence scores ranged from 4 to 9 with a mean of 7.37 (SD = 1.24), indicating generally moderate to high confidence in survival benefit assessments.

Geographic distribution showed minimal clustering, with no single region contributing more than 15% of practices. Climate zones included arctic (8.6%), temperate (31.8%), tropical (29.1%), desert/arid (18.5%), and mixed/varied (12.0%) environments, ensuring adequate representation across environmental contexts relevant to survival pressures.

### Reliability and Validity

This initial analysis represents a single-coder study with systematic methodology designed for future validation. The coding framework and evidence classifications reflect one researcher's analysis using established criteria and extensive source documentation. While inter-rater reliability testing has not yet been conducted, the transparent methodology and complete source documentation enable future validation studies.

Content validity was assessed through extensive literature review and systematic source documentation, with evidence classifications based on published academic research across multiple disciplines. The methodology prioritizes transparency and replicability, with complete database and coding protocols available as supplementary materials.

Future research should include independent coding validation, expert review panels, and statistical verification of the evidence classification system. The current findings should be considered preliminary pending such validation, though the systematic methodology and extensive documentation provide a foundation for rigorous follow-up research on religious practices as survival technologies.
