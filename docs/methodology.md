## Overview

This document describes the systematic methodology used to code and analyze 151 religious practices across 74 cultures for potential survival benefits. The framework ensures consistent, replicable analysis while maintaining academic rigor.

## Survival Benefit Classification System

### Five Primary Domains

#### 1. Food Safety & Nutrition (FSN)
**Subcategories:**
- **FSN-1**: Foodborne illness prevention
- **FSN-2**: Poisoning/toxin avoidance  
- **FSN-3**: Nutritional optimization
- **FSN-4**: Food preservation techniques
- **FSN-5**: Seasonal eating patterns
- **FSN-6**: Fasting/feast cycle management

#### 2. Disease Prevention & Health (DPH)
**Subcategories:**
- **DPH-1**: Hygiene and sanitation
- **DPH-2**: Quarantine and isolation
- **DPH-3**: Reproductive health
- **DPH-4**: Mental health and stress management
- **DPH-5**: Substance abuse prevention
- **DPH-6**: Injury prevention

#### 3. Resource Conservation & Management (RCM)
**Subcategories:**
- **RCM-1**: Water conservation
- **RCM-2**: Energy/fuel management
- **RCM-3**: Tool and equipment preservation
- **RCM-4**: Sustainable hunting/fishing
- **RCM-5**: Agricultural sustainability
- **RCM-6**: Waste reduction

#### 4. Social Cooperation & Stability (SCS)
**Subcategories:**
- **SCS-1**: Conflict resolution
- **SCS-2**: Leadership stability
- **SCS-3**: Resource sharing
- **SCS-4**: Group cohesion
- **SCS-5**: Information transmission
- **SCS-6**: Crisis coordination

#### 5. Environmental Adaptation (EA)
**Subcategories:**
- **EA-1**: Climate adaptation
- **EA-2**: Seasonal preparation
- **EA-3**: Natural disaster response
- **EA-4**: Predator/danger avoidance
- **EA-5**: Migration and movement
- **EA-6**: Ecosystem integration

## Evidence Quality Rating System

### Quality Levels (1-5 Scale)

**Level 5 - Definitive**
- Peer-reviewed scientific studies confirming benefit
- Clear causal mechanism with quantified outcomes
- Multiple independent confirmations
- No significant contradictory evidence

**Level 4 - Strong**
- Well-documented correlation with logical mechanism
- Expert consensus on benefit
- Some quantitative support
- Minor contradictory evidence that doesn't undermine core benefit

**Level 3 - Moderate**
- Clear logical connection to survival benefit
- Some documentary evidence
- Reasonable expert support
- Mixed or limited contradictory evidence

**Level 2 - Suggestive**
- Plausible survival connection
- Limited direct evidence
- Expert opinion varies
- Some contradictory evidence exists

**Level 1 - Speculative**
- Possible survival benefit requiring further investigation
- Minimal supporting evidence
- Significant expert disagreement
- Substantial contradictory evidence

### Documentation Requirements by Level

**Level 5**: Minimum 3 peer-reviewed sources + quantitative data
**Level 4**: Minimum 2 academic sources + expert opinion
**Level 3**: Minimum 1 academic source + 2 reputable sources
**Level 2**: Minimum 2 reputable sources + logical analysis
**Level 1**: Minimum 1 source + clear research questions for further investigation

## Confounding Variable Controls

### Geographic Clustering Control
**Variables to Track:**
- Distance between cultures (km)
- Trade route connections
- Historical contact evidence
- Migration patterns
- Language family relationships

### Environmental Similarity Control
**Variables to Track:**
- Climate type and severity
- Resource availability
- Natural hazards present
- Seasonal variation patterns
- Ecological pressures

### Cultural Contact Control
**Variables to Track:**
- Historical interaction evidence
- Religious conversion/influence
- Colonial/conquest history
- Modern globalization impact
- Missionary activity presence

### Temporal Control
**Variables to Track:**
- Practice antiquity estimates
- Historical development timeline
- Modification evidence over time
- Contemporary vs. traditional forms
- Preservation vs. innovation patterns

## Quality Assurance Protocol

### Coding Standards
- Systematic literature review for each practice
- Multiple source verification required
- Transparent uncertainty acknowledgment
- Regular methodology consistency checks
- Complete source documentation

### Validation Approach
- Single-coder initial analysis with documented methodology
- Transparent criteria for future inter-rater reliability testing
- Open data and methodology for independent verification
- Expert consultation invitation for specialized domains
- Community feedback integration protocols

## Limitations and Future Directions

### Current Limitations
- Single-coder analysis pending validation
- Limited quantitative outcome data for some practices
- Cultural interpretation challenges across diverse societies
- Temporal depth variations in source quality

### Planned Improvements
- Inter-rater reliability testing with multiple coders
- Expert panel validation across relevant disciplines
- Expanded cultural sample with additional practices
- Longitudinal analysis of practice effectiveness
